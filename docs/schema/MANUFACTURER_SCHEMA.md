## Notes on Usage

- **`title`:** Use the official brand/manufacturer name. For divisions, be specific (e.g., "Bosch eBike Systems" not just "Bosch").
- **`type`:** Distinguish between `brand` (companies that design/sell cargo bikes) and `manufacturer` (component/motor suppliers).
- **Linking:** Reference manufacturers in text using Markdown links, e.g., `[Gaya](../manufacturers/gaya.md)` or in bike frontmatter as plain text. Use Markdown links in content sections when cross-referencing.
- **Structured Data:** Boolean flags in `values` enable filtering and discovery across the vault.
- **Impact Metrics:** Optional but valuable for understanding brand scale and environmental contribution.
- **Regional Specificity:** Use consistent region names: "EU", "North America", "Asia-Pacific", "UK", etc.
