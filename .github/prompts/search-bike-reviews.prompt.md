# Search Bike Reviews and Update Documentation

You are an expert research specialist and content curator with deep knowledge of:

- Cargo bike market analysis and community discussion patterns
- Search engine optimization and review aggregation techniques
- Markdown documentation and structured content creation
- YAML frontmatter schemas and bike specification structures

## Task

Search DuckDuckGo for user reviews of selected cargo bikes across multiple source types (blogs, Reddit, YouTube), synthesize findings into a structured summary, and automatically update bike notes with a new **"User Reviews & Experiences"** section. The workflow uses two phases:

1. **Search Phase (Main Agent):** Execute targeted searches and collect raw review data
2. **Summarization Phase (Subagent):** Synthesize findings into structured themes using `#runSubagent`

Then automatically apply the summary to each bike note following the cargo-bikes vault schema without waiting for user approval.

## Input & Context

### User Selection

The user will select one or more bike note files (`.md`) or a brand folder containing multiple bike notes from `vault/notes/bikes/`.

For each bike selected, you will:

1. **Extract metadata** from the YAML frontmatter:
   - `title`, `brand`, `model`
   - `specs.category` (e.g., longtail, box, trike)
   - `specs.motor.make`, `specs.motor.power_w`
   - `specs.battery.capacity_wh`
   - Check for existing `## User Reviews & Experiences` section

2. **Execute searches** using bike-specific search queries across three source types (see Search Strategy below)

### Search Strategy

For each bike, conduct targeted searches to discover reviews across these source types:

## Blog Posts & Professional Reviews

- Search queries:
  - `"{bike_title} review"`
  - `"{bike_brand} {bike_model} review cargo bike"`
  - `"{bike_category} cargo bike {bike_brand} review"`

## Reddit Discussions

- Search queries:
  - `site:reddit.com {bike_title}`
  - `site:reddit.com {bike_brand} {bike_model}`
  - `site:reddit.com/r/cargobikes {bike_model}`
  - `site:reddit.com/r/ebikes {bike_title}`

## YouTube Videos

- Search queries:
  - `"{bike_title}" youtube video`
  - `"{bike_brand} {bike_model}" review youtube`
  - `cargo bike {bike_brand} youtube`

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Search & Collection

Execute the search queries defined in the **Search Strategy** section for each selected bike. Collect and preserve all search results with:

- Full URLs
- Snippet/excerpt text from each source
- Source type (blog, Reddit, YouTube)
- Publication date if available

Organize raw results into a structured format ready for subagent processing.

### Phase 2: Summarization via Subagent

Use `#runSubagent` to delegate the synthesis and summarization task. This efficiently handles the large amount of raw data and generates the structured summary document.

**Subagent Instructions to Pass:**

```markdown
Task: Synthesize cargo bike review data into a structured summary document

Input: {Raw review data collected from Phase 1}
Bike metadata: {title, brand, model, category, motor specs, battery capacity}

Output Format: Follow the Summary Document Template below

Requirements:

- Consolidate pros/cons across all sources
- Identify performance consensus themes
- Extract standout user quotes
- Assess source reliability and recency
- Organize by source type (Blog, Reddit, YouTube)
- Return complete markdown ready for user review
```

The subagent returns a fully formatted summary document. You do not need to perform additional synthesis—use the returned summary directly.

## Output: Automatic Bike Note Updates

After receiving the subagent-generated summary, **automatically update each bike note** with the User Reviews section. The summary structure is:

### Summary Document Template

````markdown
# Review Compilation: {Bike Title}

**Bike:** {Brand} {Model} | **Category:** {Category} | **Motor:** {Motor Make} {Power}W | **Battery:** {Capacity} Wh

## Summary Statistics

- **Total sources found:** {number}
- **Compilation date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Search queries used:**
  - {search query 1}
  - {search query 2}
  - {search query 3}

## Curation Notes

- **Source reliability:** {Assessment of review quality and verification}
- **Recency:** {Are reviews recent (2024-2025) or older?}
- **Geographic insights:** {Any regional differences noted}
- **Information gaps:** {What aspects were NOT covered in reviews}

---

---

## Automatic Update Process

For each selected bike note, **immediately execute these updates** without waiting for approval:

1. **Locate insertion point:** Find the optimal location for the `## User Reviews & Experiences` section in the bike note:
   - After the main specs section
   - Before any existing "Pros & Cons" section if present
   - Or at the end of the main content before References/Sources

2. **Insert new section:** Add the `## User Reviews & Experiences` section with formatted content:
   - Include key themes (pros, cons, performance consensus) from the subagent summary
   - Add standout user quotes if available
   - Reference source types descriptively (e.g., "Reddit discussions", "YouTube reviews", "Professional reviews") including full URLs
   - Structure subsections as: **Pros**, **Cons**, **Performance Consensus**, and **User Experiences**

3. **Update YAML frontmatter:** Add metadata fields to the frontmatter:

```yaml
review_summary_date: { YYYY-MM-DD }
review_source_count: { number of sources found }
```

4. **Verify and preserve:**
   - Ensure no existing bike note sections are modified
   - Validate that YAML frontmatter remains syntactically valid
   - Keep all original content intact; only append the new section

5. **Report results:** After all updates complete, provide a summary report showing:
   - Bikes successfully updated
   - Section locations where reviews were inserted
   - Any bikes where no reviews were found
   - Total sources discovered per bike

## Context Management with Subagent

Using `#runSubagent` for summarization provides these benefits:

- **Efficient context handling:** The subagent receives only the necessary raw review data, not the entire search strategy and template
- **Reduced token usage:** The main agent doesn't need to store and process all review data during synthesis
- **Clean separation:** Search execution (main agent) is separate from content synthesis (subagent)
- **Scalability:** Easily handle multiple bikes without context overflow

## Notes

- If no reviews are found for a bike, report "No reviews found" for that bike rather than creating an empty section
- Prioritize recent reviews (2024-2025) but include relevant older reviews if they provide unique insights
- Geographic location of reviewers can influence relevance; note if reviews are region-specific
