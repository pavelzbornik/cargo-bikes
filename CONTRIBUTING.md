# Contributing to the cargo-bikes vault

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Please follow these simple rules so the vault stays consistent and useful.

Frontmatter rules

- Every note should start with a YAML frontmatter block. Required keys for bike pages: `title`, `type: bike`, `tags`.
- Use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) for `date`.
- Use lower-case hyphenated tags when possible (e.g. `long-tail`, `electric-assist`).

PR checklist

1. One logical change per PR (add/modify a single note or template).
2. Include sources for factual claims where possible (links in a References section).
3. Validate that markdown renders and frontmatter is present.

Style

- Use concise headings and short paragraphs.
- Prefer lists for specs and steps.

If you're unsure, open an issue first to discuss.
