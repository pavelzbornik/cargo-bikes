# Vault structure and conventions

This folder contains the content of the public Obsidian vault for cargo bikes.

Structure

- `notes/` — individual notes for bikes, topics and how-tos.
- `templates/` — Markdown templates to create new notes with standardized frontmatter.

Frontmatter conventions

Each note should include a YAML frontmatter block with keys: `title`, `type`, `tags`, and optional `brand`, `model`, `date`. Use `type: bike` for specific bike pages.
