## Overview

The estarli e-cargo Longtail L20 is a family-focused electric cargo longtail designed for affordable, practical everyday transport. Developed by UK-based estarli, it combines commuter-friendly dimensions with substantial cargo capacity, making it ideal for school runs, family outings, and mixed-load carrying.

Co-founder Alex Francis positioned it as "more affordable than many market-leading e-cargo bikes" while maintaining the longtail geometry that "rides the most like normal bikes." The bike has gained recognition in the cycling industry, with testing at the 2023 e-Bike Summit in Oxford and coverage from Ebiketips and Cycling Industry News.

## Professional Reviews

**Cycling Industry News (e-Bike Summit 2023):**

**Ebiketips (Full Afternoon Test):**

> "It was hard to fault this e-bike and the ease with which it took on the test ground - including some nice quality off-road bridleways - made its performance even more impressive... the RRP of £2,995 looks extremely competitive as most mid-drive e-cargo longtails with this carrying capacity start at around £4,000."
