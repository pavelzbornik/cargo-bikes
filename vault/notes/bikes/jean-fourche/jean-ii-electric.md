## Jean Fourche II

Jean Fourche represents a radical rethinking of the longtail concept through a French lens. Founded in Bordeaux by three friends in a participatory workshop, the brand prioritizes social impact, environmental responsibility, and innovative design.

## Overview

The Jean Fourche II is revolutionary in its compactness—at just 175 cm (plus 10 cm with safety bar), it's the shortest longtail on the market. Weighing only 27 kg, it challenges the assumption that cargo bikes must be massive and heavy. The innovative French-made Virvolt motor (80 Nm, just 3 kg) delivers confident assistance while maintaining a sleek profile. Assembly is local (Bordeaux), with 80% of components sourced from France and Europe, supporting an entire supply chain ecosystem.

## Technical Specifications

- **Frame:** Aluminum (Portuguese manufacture, Bordeaux assembly)
- **Length:** 175 cm (185 cm with safety bar)
- **Weight:** 27 kg (with battery)
- **Load capacity:** 85 kg cargo + rider (2-child configuration)
- **Motor:** Virvolt 900 (French-made, 80 Nm)
- **Battery:** 540 Wh removable (720 Wh optional)
- **Range:** 40-60 km (standard battery)
- **Drivetrain:** Chain, Shimano Altus 8-speed
- **Brakes:** Shimano hydraulic disc (180 mm rotors)
- **Wheels:** 24" front and rear (symmetric)
- **Suspension:** None (compromised to maintain lightness)
- **Rider height:** 150-190 cm

## Design Philosophy

Jean Fourche's approach: "Small but mighty." Rather than matching competitor specifications, they asked what the minimum viable cargo bike looks like. Result: a compact, lightweight, city-friendly platform. Founded in 2018, the brand remains committed to social/solidarity economics (ESS certification).

## Real-world Performance

### Urban Agility

The compact 175 cm wheelbase makes parking and maneuvering genuinely easy compared to 210 cm competitors. Ideal for tight European cities.

### Power

The Virvolt motor (80 Nm) punches above its weight. French-made engineering ensures reliability and repairability. Local motor repair infrastructure supports long-term sustainability.

### Range & Efficiency

The 540 Wh battery with efficient Virvolt motor provides 40-60 km real-world range. The optional 720 Wh battery (€150) addresses longer commutes.

### Payload

Load capacity (85 kg cargo + rider) is slightly lower than competitors but sufficient for 2-child transport or mixed cargo.
