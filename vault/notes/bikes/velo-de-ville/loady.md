## Reviews

### Transition Vélo Test (July 2025)

#### Overall Score: 8.5/10

- **Comfort:** 8/10
- **Performance:** 9/10
- **Equipment:** 9/10
- **Autonomy:** 7/10

#### Test Summary

The Loady is Velo de Ville's only compact cargo longtail, and like all products from the German manufacturer, it benefits from extensive customization and configurability. It successfully bridges urban agility (1.90 m length, 20" wheels) with practical family transport (75 kg rear platform capacity). The Performance Line CX motor, belt drive option, and thoughtful design make it versatile for daily commuting and weekend family outings. However, the limited battery range (545 Wh provides moderate autonomy) and Enviolo AutomatiQ's limited manual control detract slightly from the otherwise comprehensive offering.

#### Test Pros

- Comfortable, maniable, and stable in all conditions
- 180 kg total capacity (200 kg with Enviolo HD)
- Bosch Performance Line CX powerful and responsive
- Frame color and component customization
- Belt drive transmission (low maintenance)
- Powerful lighting with brake light function
- Very practical for daily family use

#### Test Cons

- Enviolo AutomatiQ manual control limited to 9 levels
- Three separate apps required (Bosch Flow, Enviolo, Velowallet)
- No ABS option available
- Battery range moderate with 545 Wh
- Children must climb over guiding bars
- Limited brake light function on standard lighting
