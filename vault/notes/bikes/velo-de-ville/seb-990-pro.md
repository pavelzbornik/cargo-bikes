![Velo de Ville SEB 990 Pro](https://www.transitionvelo.com/content/uploads/2025/05/Velo-de-ville-SEB-990-Pro-8-1024x576.jpg)

## Overview

The Velo de Ville SEB 990 Pro is a unique German electric cargo bike that functions as a standard-sized e-bike while being able to transport a passenger of up to 60 kg with the optional "Cargo Kit." This is one of the rarest cargo bikes on the market—a dual-purpose vehicle that can handle daily commuting like a normal e-bike and transform into a biplace with integrated passenger seat. Fully customizable with extensive component choices, the SEB 990 Pro represents German engineering excellence in the cargo segment.
