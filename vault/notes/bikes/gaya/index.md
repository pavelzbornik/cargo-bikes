## Overview

Gaya is a French electric cargo bike manufacturer focused on simplifying urban life for families and professionals. According to their official website, the company designs bikes "with urbain·e·s for their daily lives much-too-rock-&-roll." The brand emphasizes accessibility, safety, and community co-design in creating practical cargo solutions for urban transportation.

Since the end of 2023, Gaya has assembled all bikes in France in Vendée, reflecting a commitment to supporting local employment and preserving local manufacturing expertise.

## Brand Philosophy & Positioning

Gaya's positioning emphasizes **simplifying urban life through accessible, secure, family-focused electric cargo bikes**. According to their official brand messaging, GAYA bikes are designed to "simplify the city" ("Simplifiez la vi(ll)e") and make daily urban transport more practical and enjoyable.

### Key Design Principles

**Community Co-Design:** Unlike traditional top-down design, GAYA evolved through continuous feedback from its community. From early prototypes through current models, user input has shaped bike features, geometry, and accessory ecosystems. This collaborative approach positions GAYA as user-centric rather than purely manufacturer-driven.

**Comprehensive Safety & Visibility:** GAYA emphasizes built-in safety rather than treating it as an afterthought. All models include integrated LED front lights (125 lm—high visibility), rear brake lights, front and rear turn signals, electronic horn, and mechanical bell. This comprehensive safety package reflects GAYA's positioning as family-safe transportation.

**Integrated Digital Security:** GPS geolocation via the GAYA mobile app, NFC badge locks, remote surveillance mode with motor lockout, and 105dB alarms differentiate GAYA in a crowded market. This "security at your fingertips" approach appeals to urban users concerned about theft and bike management.

**French Manufacturing Commitment:** Since end 2023, GAYA assembles all bikes in Vendée, France. This deliberate choice to manufacture locally (rather than importing finished bikes) reflects values of supporting employment, preserving manufacturing expertise, and reducing transportation emissions. It positions GAYA as supporting local economic sustainability alongside environmental sustainability.

**Accessibility & Inclusivity:** With price points from €2,300 (entry-level Compact) to €3,400 (premium L'Incroyable Long), GAYA targets middle-income urban families rather than ultra-premium segments. The brand emphasizes diverse use cases: solo commuting, duo travel, family outings with multiple children.

### Market Positioning

Gaya positions itself in the **accessible-to-mid-premium cargo bike segment** for European urban families. The two-line strategy (L'Original and L'Incroyable) allows customers to choose based on comfort and budget: L'Original emphasizes value and essentials, while L'Incroyable adds suspension, integrated GPS, and premium comfort. Both emphasize safety, built-in electronics, and smart connectivity—differentiating from traditional cargo bikes and appealing to tech-savvy urban users.
