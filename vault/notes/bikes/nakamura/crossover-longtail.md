![Nakamura Crossover Longtail](https://www.transitionvelo.com/content/uploads/2024/02/Nakamura-Crossover-Longtail-entier-2-1024x576.jpg)

## Overview

The Nakamura Crossover Longtail is a versatile electric cargo longtail designed to transport multiple passengers or cargo loads. With its extended rear rack, it accommodates various configurations: 2 adults, 2 child seats, 1 passenger + 1 child, or simply groceries. The bike stands out for its comprehensive factory equipment including telescopic seatpost, direction damper, and multiple safety features. At €3000, it represents an excellent value proposition in the cargo e-bike market, particularly for families looking to transport children or significant loads.

## Technical Specifications

<!-- BIKE_SPECS_TABLE_START -->
<!-- BIKE_SPECS_TABLE_END -->

- **Load capacity:** 170 kg total, 80 kg rear rack, 10 kg front basket
- **Rider height range:** 160-190 cm
- **Frame material:** Aluminum with reinforced structure

## E-bike Features

- **Assist levels:** 4 modes (Eco, Sport, Smart, Boost)
  - Eco & Sport: Low power (~300W in Sport), minimally useful for this heavy bike
  - Smart: ~580W, linear and progressive, suitable for moderate power needs
  - Boost: ~650W, most powerful mode for loaded cycling and hills
- **Display:** LCD screen with limited information display (one info at a time: battery level, speed, assistance mode, ODO, trip distance, motor power, rider power, consumption, estimated range); USB charging port
- **Charging time:** 4 hours (main battery at 4A), 3 hours to 85%, +40 minutes to full; auxiliary battery: 2 hours
- **Security features:** Motor lock via smartphone app (4-digit code), integrated bell, front and rear lights
- **Weather resistance:** Full mudguards, rear wheel protections for passengers, water splash protection
- **Connectivity:** Naka E-Power app (iOS/Android) for motor lock and battery info

## Real-world Performance

### Range & Power

- **Real-world tested range:** ~50 km with both batteries at maximum assist (Boost mode) with realistic mixed loads (pilot 80 kg, school runs with children 40 kg, heavy loads 80 kg)
- **Hill performance:** Successfully climbs steep grades (8%) with 80 kg load, though speed reduced to 12-13 km/h
- **Motor responsiveness:** Powerful but perceived slightly less potent than Bosch Cargo Line (85 Nm); comparable or slightly slower acceleration than the Decathlon Velocargo with rear hub motor (58 Nm)

### Comfort & Handling

- **Riding position:** Slightly forward lean for 1.80 m rider; low top tube for easy mounting
- **Suspension:** 120 mm telescopic fork (spring-suspended, can be locked); fork lacks sensitivity on small bumps but effective on curb hops and potholes; occasional sticking issue noted
- **Noise levels:** Not specifically mentioned; typical for mid-drive systems
- **Ease of mounting/dismounting:** Telescopic seatpost (120 mm travel) greatly facilitates mounting; allows easy seat height adjustment on-the-fly without tools
- **Comfort unloaded:** Overly rigid frame without cargo; aluminum structure with three rear stays doesn't absorb vibrations well; short seat tube contributes to harsh rides
- **Comfort loaded:** Significantly improves when carrying cargo; frame damping becomes almost comfortable
- **Pedals:** Wide plastic pedals with good shoe contact surface; may slip with hard-soled street shoes lacking rubber
- **Handlebars:** Semi-ergonomic grips (relatively hard rubber) don't fully absorb vibrations; adjustable stem for height customization

## Cost

Estimated breakdown for typical 2-child family usage:

- **Base bike:** €3000
- **Frame:** Reinforced aluminum longtail with integrated main battery
- **Standard equipment included:** Telescopic seatpost, direction damper, 2 passive seats, footrests, safety bars, rear protections, central kickstand, front basket, mudguards
- **Total for basic use with children:** €3000 (all essential equipment already included)

**Optional accessories for enhanced setup:**

- Higher-quality tires (Schwalbe Pick-up 27.5"): ~€150
- Schwalbe Pick-up 24" rear tire: ~€130
- MIK-HD child seat (instead of passive seat): ~€100-150
- Frame lock: ~€50-100
- Additional lights/security: ~€50-100

## User Reviews & Experiences

### Pros

- Comprehensive factory equipment (seats, protection bars, mudguards, basket, kickstand) - impressive for the price point
- Telescopic seatpost (120 mm) enabling height adjustment without tools and multi-user compatibility
- Direction damper (Canecreek Viscoset) stabilizing handlebar and reducing unwanted oscillations - feature typically found on much more expensive bikes
- Powerful motor with good hill-climbing ability
- Dual battery system offers modularity and real-world autonomy (~50 km tested)
- Excellent hydraulic braking system (4-piston, 200mm/180mm discs) - stops effectively even when fully loaded
- 170 kg total load capacity suitable for family transport
- Low price point (€3000) with extensive equipment compared to competitors

### Cons

- Overly rigid when unloaded; harsh ride without cargo weight to dampen vibrations
- LCD display has poor visibility in direct sunlight and limited information (only one data point displayable at a time)
- Secondary battery lacks security - not locked and must be carried when leaving bike; vulnerable cable connection
- Heavy (44-45 kg) makes maneuvering difficult
- No integrated frame lock; motor app lock less practical than mechanical lock
- Uncomfortable semi-ergonomic grips
- Steep learning curve for 9-speed derailleur usage; shift lever positioned far from grip (difficult for small hands)
- Less responsive fork on small impacts
- Comfort position mainly dependent on loading

### User Quotes

> "An affordable all-option cargo bike. For users looking for a bike to transport children, adults, or significant loads, this is clearly an interesting choice at €3000."
> — Transition Vélo Review

## Cargo Capacity & Use Cases

- **Typical loads tested:** School runs with children (40 kg), mixed heavy loads (80 kg), dual passenger configurations
- **Child seat compatibility:** Fitted with 2 passive seats; compatible with MIK-HD child seats (27 kg capacity each)
- **Passenger capacity:** Can safely accommodate multiple configurations depending on weight distribution
- **Rear rack capacity:** 80 kg dedicated load capacity
- **Front basket:** 10 kg capacity, suitable for grocery bags or small items
- **Total system load:** 170 kg maximum (including bike 45 kg + rider + cargo/passengers)
- **Commuting suitability:** Excellent for school runs, family outings, and local deliveries; real-world range of 50 km suitable for daily urban commuting with cargo
- **Cargo configurations:**
  - 2 adult passengers
  - 2 child passengers on fitted seats
  - 1 adult + 1 child passenger
  - Mixed cargo (groceries, packages)
  - Multiple configurations possible within weight limits

## Maintenance

- **Battery maintenance:** Dual-battery system requires monitoring; main battery (520 Wh) integrated in frame, removable but requires secure storage; auxiliary battery (250 Wh) easier to manage with handle but lacks security lock
- **Motor service intervals:** Mid-drive Naka E-Power Max (custom Ananda motor) requires standard pedal crank maintenance; no specific intervals mentioned in review
- **Brake maintenance:** Shimano hydraulic disc brakes require periodic bleed maintenance; large disc sizes (200/180 mm) benefit from heat dissipation during extended braking
- **Tire recommendations:** Standard 2.5 bar pressure; Schwalbe Super Moto-X listed but generic tires provided on test model; Schwalbe Pick-up series recommended for better puncture resistance
- **Chain care:** Standard 9-speed chain maintenance; chain drive system less complex than hub motors

## Modifications & Customization

- **Available upgrade options:**
  - Tire upgrade to Schwalbe Pick-up series for better comfort and puncture resistance
  - MIK-HD compatible child seats (replaces factory passive seats)
  - Suspension seatpost to replace current rigid seatpost for improved comfort when unloaded
- **Common user modifications:**
  - Upgrading tires for better traction and comfort
  - Adding suspension to seatpost
  - Upgrading grips for better ergonomics
- **Compatibility with accessories:**
  - MIK-HD child seat mounts (2 available)
  - Eurobox cargo configuration (60 x 40 cm compatible format)
  - Standard handlebar and stem adjustments
