## Overview

OneSport is an emerging global e-bike manufacturer founded in 2023, specializing in direct-to-consumer electric bikes at accessible price points. Operating under the tagline "No Tricks, Just Sweet Rides," the brand focuses on delivering affordable, high-value e-bikes across multiple categories including cargo bikes, urban commuters, and foldable models. As of July 2025, OneSport celebrated its second anniversary, marking significant growth in its e-bike portfolio and international market presence across Europe and North America.

The company's direct sales model eliminates intermediaries, allowing OneSport to offer competitive pricing while maintaining profit margins. This approach has enabled rapid product development and market expansion, with the brand introducing new models regularly, including the recently announced OT12 urban commuter and OT02 compact folding e-bike.

OneSport's cargo bike line emphasizes practical functionality and load capacity. The OT01 longtail offers a high-capacity battery and substantial cargo deck for families and delivery professionals, while the OT30 and OT30 Pro trikes provide three-wheel stability for maximum cargo security and rider confidence.

## Brand Philosophy & Positioning

OneSport positions itself as a direct-sales e-bike manufacturer delivering exceptional value through eliminated middlemen. The brand's slogan, "No Tricks, Just Sweet Rides," reflects a commitment to straightforward pricing, transparent specifications, and practical bike design focused on real-world use rather than premium branding.

The company's approach emphasizes:

- **Affordability**: Competitive pricing enabled by direct sales model and efficient manufacturing
- **Diversity**: Multiple bike categories (cargo, city, foldable, fat-tire) serving varied rider needs
- **Practicality**: Functional design with cargo capacity, stability, and commute-focused features
- **Accessibility**: Entry-level to mid-range pricing making e-bikes accessible to broader audiences
- **Innovation**: Rapid product development with regular new model introductions

The cargo bike line reflects this philosophy—delivering capable cargo bikes at accessible prices rather than positioning as premium/ultra-premium alternatives. The OT01 longtail and OT30/OT30 Pro trikes offer substantial load capacity and practical features without extreme price premiums.
