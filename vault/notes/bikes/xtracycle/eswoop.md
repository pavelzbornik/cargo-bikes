## Maintenance

- **Battery maintenance:** Removable 630Wh battery is easy to access for charging; Shimano STEPS system is sealed and maintenance-free; replace every 3-5 years in typical use
- **Motor service:** Shimano mid-drive system requires no regular maintenance; service typically only needed for major issues (covered under warranty)
- **Brake maintenance:** 4-piston hydraulic brakes with self-adjustment reduce maintenance; pads and rotors should be inspected annually

- **Drivetrain:** SRAM 11-speed chain and cassette benefit from regular cleaning and lubrication; chain life typically 1,500-2,000 km

## Modifications & Customization

- **Accessory ecosystem:** Extensive Xtracycle-designed accessory compatibility (Hooptie, BoomBox, PorterRack, etc.)
