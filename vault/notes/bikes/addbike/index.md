## Overview

AddBike is a French cargo bike manufacturer headquartered in Lyon, France, dedicated to democratizing cargo bikes for urban families. According to their official website, AddBike specializes in innovative electric cargo solutions designed through their own research unit in Villeurbanne, incorporating customer feedback to create bikes that adapt to diverse urban mobility needs.

The company's core mission is centered on "betting on cargo bikes as the future of daily transportation." AddBike emphasizes that cargo bikes are more than just practical vehicles—they are vectors of social connection, economic resilience, ecological sustainability, and personal well-being. By creating adaptable systems, AddBike enables families to transition seamlessly between child transport and cargo transport modes without purchasing multiple vehicles.

AddBike distinguishes itself through a modular, user-centric design philosophy. Rather than offering fixed cargo solutions, the brand offers customizable platforms and accessories that transform standard bicycles or specialized cargo frames to meet different daily needs. Their products range from dedicated electric cargo bikes (U-Cargo family) to the AddBike+ system, which converts conventional bikes into three-wheeled cargo systems.

## Brand Philosophy & Positioning

### Adaptability Through Modularity

AddBike's defining characteristic is its **modular, transformable approach** to cargo bikes. Rather than designing single-purpose vehicles, AddBike creates systems that evolve with families' changing needs throughout the day or across seasons. The flagship U-Cargo's Switch2Carry system exemplifies this philosophy—allowing parents to transition from transporting two children to shopping mode in seconds without removing safety features.

### Safety as Priority

Safety is woven throughout AddBike's design ethos. The U-Cargo features the Protech'360 system: a metal frame completely enclosed in protective textile, protecting children from feet to lower back with an exterior-opening door that prevents children from accidentally opening during transit. Compatible with leading child seat brands (Thule, Hamax, Polisport), the U-Cargo offers flexibility within a safety framework.

### Democratic Urban Mobility

AddBike positions itself at the **"accessible" price tier**, making cargo bikes achievable for more urban families. The brand describes itself as offering an alternative to large cargo bikes—the U-Cargo provides three-wheeler stability and capacity without the bulk, handling, or storage challenges of traditional trikes. This makes cargo biking practical for apartment dwellers and urban commuters with limited space.

### Local Manufacturing & Community Focus

AddBike's products are **designed and assembled in France** through partnerships with Usine à Vélo (a bicycle assembly cooperative) and the Grand Plateau production facility, both supported by regional Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes authorities. This commitment to local manufacturing, combined with 230+ European dealer relationships, reflects AddBike's belief in building community capacity around cargo biking.

## Manufacturing & Innovation

**Research & Development:** AddBike operates its own research unit in Villeurbanne where products are designed with systematic incorporation of customer feedback. This iterative approach has led to innovations like the Switch2Carry system and Protech'360 safety enclosure.

**Quality & Testing:** All products undergo specialized testing at accredited laboratories (Pourquery and CRITT Sports and Leisure) before market release, ensuring safety and durability standards.

**Production & Assembly:** Bikes are assembled at Usine à Vélo, a bicycle assembly cooperative supported by local authorities. This approach supports local employment and craft expertise while maintaining quality control. Final quality assurance occurs in Lyon.

**Supply & Logistics:** AddBike maintains spare parts inventory at its Lyon headquarters, enabling rapid customer support and repair services.
