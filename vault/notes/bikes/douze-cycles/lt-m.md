## Overview

The LT M is the mechanical, non-electric version of the Douze LT longtail cargo bike. It is the lightest and most economical model in the LT range, perfect for riders looking for a sustainable cargo bike without electric assistance. Equipped with a 10-speed transmission, the LT M is well-suited for flat terrain and small cargo loads. It combines the maneuverability of a traditional bike with the cargo capacity of a dedicated cargo bike.
