## Overview

The Riese & Müller Multicharger GT Family represents German premium engineering in the electric longtail segment. Distinguished by its larger 26" wheels (unique among standard longtails), it delivers a "classical bike with extended cargo platform" riding experience rather than a purpose-built longtail. German quality and comprehensive standard accessories set it apart in the high-end market segment.
