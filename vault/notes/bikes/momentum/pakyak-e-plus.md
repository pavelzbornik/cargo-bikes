## Momentum PakYak E+

![Momentum PakYak E+](https://www.transitionvelo.com/content/uploads/2023/12/momentum-pakyak-26-1024x576.jpg)

## Overview

The Momentum PakYak E+ is the first electric cargo longtail from Momentum, Giant's urban brand, launched in France in 2023. Designed to combine the strength of a buffalo with the agility of a puma, the PakYak E+ offers impressive 220 kg total load capacity on 24-inch wheels—unique geometry for cargo longtails. With the Giant SyncDrive Pro motor (80 Nm torque) and robust hydraulic brakes, this aluminum longtail promises powerful performance for families seeking serious cargo capability. However, at €4,700+, component choices (Shimano Alivio 9-speed drivetrain) feel underwhelming for the price point.

## Technical Specifications

<!-- BIKE_SPECS_TABLE_START -->
<!-- BIKE_SPECS_TABLE_END -->

- **Price:** €4,700 (base price without accessories)
- **Weight:** ~33 kg (estimated frame + components)
- **Frame:** Aluminum, robust construction; single size (1.60–1.90 m riders)
- **Wheel size:** 24" (unique for cargo longtails; lowers center of gravity vs. 26–28")
- **Motor:** Giant SyncDrive Pro, 80 Nm torque, central mount (Yamaha-based)
- **Battery:** 500 Wh, integrated into frame diagonal, removable
- **Brakes:** Tektro HD-E737 hydraulic disc, 4-piston (front & rear), 203 mm rotors
- **Drivetrain:** Shimano Alivio 9-speed chain (undersized for this bike class)
- **Tires:** Maxxis Hookworm 24" (2.5" front), Maxxis Rekon 24" (2.2" rear, all-terrain profile)
- **Suspension:** None (rigid frame with large tires for cushioning)
- **Saddle:** Comfortable, wide design; mounted on telescopic stem with 40 mm suspension
- **Load capacity:** 220 kg total (includes rider + cargo + accessories)
- **Front cargo:** Built-in basket, 15 kg max
- **Rear cargo platform:** Extended longtail design supports 2 children with seats or 1 adult
- **Positioning:** Neutral, upright geometry; dynamic at handlebar due to non-adjustable stem
- **Handlebars:** 720 mm wide, curved profile; 7 cm drop offset

## E-bike Features

- **Assist levels:** Eco, Auto (recommended for flat terrain, more economical), Sport, Turbo (very responsive)
- **Display:** Small proprietary screen; limited simultaneous data display (distance, autonomy, cadence, avg/instant speed, but must scroll)
- **Smartphone support:** No integrated mount; requires aftermarket attachment
- **Charging time:** 3.5 hours (0–100%) with 6A charger; battery extracted from frame for charging
- **Battery management:** Charging port on frame; battery extraction requires moderate force ("not fluid")
- **Security features:** No built-in frame lock; locking storage box behind seat (limited utility for riders <1.75 m)
- **Weather resistance:** Front & rear mudguards (front guards short, insufficient shoe protection)
- **Chain protection:** Partially enclosed with metal bar guard (design-conscious, but less protective than full housing)

## Real-world Performance

### Range & Power

- **Mixed riding (Turbo mode):** ~50 km with ~700 m elevation gain, 65 kg rider, 10–15°C temperature
- **Flat terrain (Auto/Eco modes):** ~60 km estimated
- **Loaded performance:** 15–20% range reduction with 50+ kg cargo/passengers
- **Motor responsiveness:** Excellent; Giant SyncDrive Pro delivers smooth, powerful acceleration even fully loaded
- **Hill performance:** Maintained 17–18 km/h average on steep climbs while loaded (competitors achieve only 15 km/h)

### Comfort & Handling

- **Riding position:** Neutral, dynamic at handlebar; non-adjustable stem forces tall riders into upright position, smaller riders more forward
- **Saddle:** Comfortable, wide, well-padded; excellent for long journeys
- **Seat adjustment:** Telescopic stem with 7 cm range + 40 mm suspension—excellent for multi-rider households
- **Suspension feel:** Large 24" tires (2.5" front, 2.2" rear) do most cushioning; 40 mm seatpost suspension augments comfort
- **Tire comfort:** Wide Maxxis tires absorb vibrations beautifully on smooth roads; less effective on cobblestone
- **Handlebar width:** 720 mm very wide; excellent stability and security feeling, especially fully loaded
- **Stability:** Excellent; low center of gravity (24" wheels + suspension) makes the bike very confident even at maximum load
- **Agility:** Good for a longtail; 24" wheels contribute to maneuverability in tight urban corners
- **Motor noise:** SyncDrive Pro audible but not disruptive in urban settings
- **Drivetrain note:** Shimano Alivio 9-speed shows gear shift delay under high motor torque; poor synergy with this power class

## Cost

Momentum's entry-level cargo positioning offers reasonable base pricing but significant accessory costs:

- **Base price:** €4,700 (2023 test; current pricing may vary)
- **Accessories:**
  - Rear grab bars (passenger safety): €200
  - Footrests (cale-pieds): €139
  - Saddle cushion: €69
  - Wheel guards (spoke protection): €69
  - Secondary battery support bracket: €159
  - Secondary battery (750 Wh, additional): €749
  - Front basket removal: Not required but offered

**Two-child configuration:** Base + grab bars (€200) + footrests (€139) + wheel guards (€69) = ~€5,100 total

## User Reviews & Experiences

### Pros

- **Excellent motor performance:** Giant SyncDrive Pro (80 Nm) delivers powerful acceleration with loaded cargo
- **Very effective braking:** Tektro HD-E737 4-piston hydraulics with 203 mm rotors excel at stopping mass
- **Comfortable, confident ride:** Telescopic/suspended seatpost, wide tires, low center of gravity inspire confidence
- **Robust construction:** Aluminum frame and rear platform exude solidity and durability
- **Good finishes:** Overall assembly quality high; frame-to-platform connection feels rock-solid
- **Large cargo capacity:** 220 kg total capacity adequate for 2 children or 1 adult + shopping
- **Dual-battery capable:** Optional 750 Wh battery extends range and utility (though at significant cost)
- **Aesthetic simplicity:** Clean, understated design avoids excessive cargo bike bulk

### Cons

- **Disappointing drivetrain:** Shimano Alivio 9-speed undersized for motor power class; slow gear shifts, requires frequent adjustment
- **Tiny display screen:** Limited simultaneous data display; single-direction scrolling navigation awkward
- **Poor storage box design:** Locking storage behind seat inaccessible for riders <1.75 m tall; plastic construction feels insecure
- **Awkward kickstand:** Center-mounted double kickstand; tilts toward front or rear depending on weight distribution (wobbles when loading/unloading children)
- **Stiff kickstand spring:** Retracts aggressively; initially concerning for new users
- **Unwieldy battery extraction:** Frame-mounted battery difficult to remove; "requires forcing"
- **No integrated lock:** Missing essential security feature for urban cargo use
- **Small front mudguard:** Insufficient shoe protection; water/mud spray reaches feet
- **Unconventional tire choice:** Rear Maxxis Rekon all-terrain profile reduces efficiency for urban riding; noise audible but not problematic
- **No smartphone integration:** Basic display limits digital features; aftermarket mounts required
- **Undersized front cargo basket:** 15 kg max limits shopping utility compared to larger front platforms

## Cargo Capacity & Use Cases

- **Two children:** Rear platform + grab bars (€200) + footrests (€139) safely seats two kids with dedicated foot support
- **One adult passenger:** Full 220 kg capacity allows comfortable adult transport (not just children)
- **Grocery shopping:** Front basket (15 kg max) + rear platform for secondary bags; limited by basket size
- **Mixed transport:** Children on rear + front basket for daily supplies workable but slightly constrained
- **Professional use:** 220 kg capacity adequate for urban delivery; robust motor handles loaded starts well
- **Dual-battery range extension:** Optional secondary battery (€749 + €159 bracket) enables all-day cargo operation

## Maintenance

- **Motor:** Giant SyncDrive Pro well-established; service widely available in urban centers
- **Battery:** Standard 500 Wh removable design; extraction challenging but serviceable
- **Drivetrain:** Shimano Alivio chain requires frequent adjustment due to motor torque; may need professional tuning
- **Brakes:** Tektro HD-E737 robust; standard hydraulic disc maintenance applies
- **Tires:** Maxxis wide tires; puncture-resistant but require higher-pressure maintenance
- **Suspension:** Telescopic seatpost straightforward maintenance; 40 mm damper serviceable
- **Overall:** More complex than simple cargo bikes due to motor system; average urban mechanic familiar with e-bikes should handle routine service

## Modifications & Customization

Momentum offers modular cargo accessories:

- **Seating:** Rear grab bars (€200), standard saddle, telescopic stem with suspension
- **Footrests:** Aluminum cale-pieds (€139), essential for child safety
- **Cargo protection:** Wheel guards (€69 pair), spoke guards for child safety
- **Storage:** Locking box behind seat (plastic, limited utility), front basket built-in
- **Display upgrades:** Proprietary screen only; no upgrade path to larger display
- **Power upgrades:** Dual-battery support (€159 bracket + €749 secondary battery) available
- **Drivetrain note:** Shimano Alivio not user-upgradeable; professional service recommended

- **Performance:** 8/10
- **Equipment:** 7/10
- **Autonomy:** 7/10

#### Test Summary

The Momentum PakYak E+ came close to being an excellent electric cargo longtail. It is "only" very good. Comfortable, performant, and capable of transporting heavy loads without hesitation, the PakYak delivers on many fronts. Unfortunately, small shortcomings diminish the overall package, as the potential is clearly present. What one might forgive in an entry-level bike is much less forgivable at nearly €5,000.

#### Test Pros

- Excellent motor finishes and performance (Giant SyncDrive Pro)
- Very effective, precise braking (Tektro HD-E737)
- Quite comfortable riding experience
- Large cargo capacity (220 kg)
- Telescopic AND suspended seatpost (excellent feature)
- Satisfactory autonomy range (50–60 km real-world)
- Robust, well-finished aluminum construction

#### Test Cons

- Disappointing 9-speed Shimano Alivio transmission (undersized for motor class; slow shift response)
- Small proprietary display (limited simultaneous data, awkward single-direction navigation)
- Poorly conceived storage box (inaccessible for riders <1.75 m; plastic feels insecure)
- Problematic kickstand (tips depending on weight distribution)
- Battery extraction requires forcing (not fluid process)
- No integrated security/locking features
- Tire choices compromise efficiency (rear all-terrain profile adds noise, drag)
