## Oklö EVO Longtail

Oklö is the emerging French cargo bike brand (since 2018) challenging European makers from Annecy, Haute-Savoie. Their EVO Longtail brings innovative French design to the premium longtail segment with a revolutionary front child seating system.

## Overview

The Oklö EVO Longtail distinguishes itself through innovation: the Fantilo front child seat is a homologated, safe system for toddlers (9 months - 4 years). Steel frame (Chromoly, European manufacture) combines robustness with vibration absorption. The Bafang M410 motor (80 Nm) delivers immediate torque from start, ideal for loaded cargo biking. At 210 cm and 33 kg, it's in the heavier premium segment, justified by premium components and innovative features.

## Technical Specifications

- **Frame:** Steel Chromoly (made in Europe, assembled in France)
- **Length:** 210 cm
- **Weight:** 33 kg (with battery)
- **Load capacity:** 200 kg total (20 kg front with child seat, 80 kg rear)
- **Motor:** Bafang M410 (80 Nm, immediate torque)
- **Battery:** 600 Wh, removable
- **Range:** 50-100 km
- **Drivetrain:** Chain, Shimano Nexus 5 internal gears
- **Brakes:** Magura MT-Sport hydraulic disc (180 mm rotors)
- **Wheels:** 24" front and rear (symmetric)
- **Suspension:** None (rigid steel frame absorbs vibration)
- **Rider height:** 150-195 cm

## Innovation: Fantilo Front Seat

The standout feature is the Fantilo front child seat—a properly engineered, homologated system for transporting one small child (9 months - 4 years, up to 20 kg) in a secure cocoon with three-point harness. Optional weatherproof canopy adds protection. This innovation enables transporting infants in front while maintaining rear cargo/passenger space.

## Real-world Performance

### Front Child Seating

The Fantilo seat places the child in a secure, visible position. Parents can monitor their child while pedaling. Combined with rear capacity, enables full three-child transport (unlikely but possible).

### Motor Performance

The Bafang M410 is less famous than Bosch but delivers impressive torque (80 Nm) immediately available from zero rpm. Ideal for loaded cargo starts and hill climbs. Five assist levels cater to various terrain.

### Handling & Stability

Steel frame at 210 cm is stable but substantial. Internal gears (Shimano Nexus 5) allow clutch-free shifting, ideal for loaded biking. The symmetric 24" wheels keep maneuverability reasonable despite length.

### Range & Efficiency

The 600 Wh battery with Bafang motor provides real-world range of 50-100 km depending on assist level and load.

## Cost & Accessories

**Base price:** €5,010
