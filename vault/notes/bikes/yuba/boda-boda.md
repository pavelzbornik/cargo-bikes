## Boda Boda

![Boda Boda](https://yubabikes.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Boda-Boda-No-BG.png)

## Overview

The Yuba Boda Boda is a unique electric cargo longtail from French-pioneer Yuba Bikes, standing apart with its 26-inch wheels—larger than the typical 20-inch cargo longtail. Named after East African bicycle taxis, it offers a refreshing compromise between urban bike handling and cargo capacity. With 200 kg load capacity and a single-speed, single-color configuration, it emphasizes simplicity and reliability. The Bosch Cargo Line motor and high-quality components (Magura brakes, Shimano Cues transmission) make it an excellent choice for families seeking performance without extensive customization.

## Reviews

### Transition Vélo Test (April 2025)

#### Overall Score: 8.5/10

- **Comfort:** 8/10
- **Performance:** 8.5/10
- **Equipment:** 8/10
- **Autonomy:** 7/10

#### Test Summary

Set apart on the cargo longtail segment with its 26" wheels, the Yuba Boda Boda is a desirable bike offering an excellent compromise between urban bike handling and cargo capabilities. Robust, agile, and performant thanks to its excellent Bosch motor, it adopts premium components (fork, brakes).

- Powerful Bosch Cargo Line motor
- Pleasant and comfortable to ride
- Reliable, safety-conscious handling behavior
- Very good brakes (Magura Thirty 2)
- Correct autonomy range
- Quality equipment and accessories

#### Test Cons

- No integrated screen or SmartphoneGrip
- No ConnectModule for geolocation
- Missing "brake light" function (rear light lacks intensity variation)
- Battery removal from underneath less convenient
- No MIK HD or AVS accessory compatibility
- Limited color options (single blue-grey)
