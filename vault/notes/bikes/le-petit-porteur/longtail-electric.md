## Le Petit Porteur Longtail Electric

![Le Petit Porteur Longtail Electric](https://shop.lepetitporteur.com/img/p/9/0/0/900.jpg)

## Overview

Le Petit Porteur Longtail combines French manufacturing heritage (originally courier bikes) with contemporary cargo transport. Based in Châtillon (Paris region), the brand evolved from professional cyclists' bikes to family-focused longtails. The most compact long-tail cargo bike on the market, it's perfect for families transporting two children in dedicated seats while maintaining exceptional city maneuverability. Aikema mid-drive motor (80 Nm) + Samsung battery provide proven reliability. Steel CrMo 4130 frame emphasizes durability and repairability over aluminum trends. Compact "midtail" design (176 cm) optimizes maneuverability while maintaining functional cargo capacity.

**Note:** Technically a compact longtail/midtail hybrid with 20" wheels, emphasizing durability and repairability.
