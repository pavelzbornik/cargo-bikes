## Overview

The Tern Orox is a premium electric cargo longtail designed for adventure and everyday family use.

With 4-inch wide tires and a reinforced aluminum frame, it handles rough terrain, sand, and light snow while maintaining family-friendly features.

## Real-world Performance

### Range & Power

- **Boost option:** Dual battery setup provides up to 1,600 Wh capacity (322 km theoretical max)
- **Turbo mode:** Full assist power for demanding situations
- **Modes:** Auto mode balances power and efficiency well

### Comfort & Handling

- **Ride quality:** Excellent suspension via massive 4" tires absorbing impacts; no front fork suspension
- **Tire cushioning:** Tires can be run as low as 0.8-1 bar for maximum comfort and traction
- **Handlebar width:** 800 mm wide bar (unusual) requires adaptation but excellent for off-road control
- **Seat:** Comfortable, neutral profile with adequate padding
- **Stability:** Exceptional in all conditions due to large tires, low center of gravity, and extended wheelbase
- **Maneuverability:** Heavy and bulky in tight urban spaces; agile on trails

### Noise & Efficiency

- **Drivetrain noise:** Belt drive (R14) is very quiet; chain (S12) standard
- **Road noise:** 4" tires can be noisy on asphalt (Schwalbe Johnny Watts quieter than Veetire Co Snow Ball)
- **Energy efficiency:** Reduced due to tire size and weight; dual battery recommended for frequent long rides

## Cost

The Tern Orox represents a significant investment. Base pricing:

- **Orox S12:** €6,799
- **Orox R14:** €9,300 (premium for belt drive and Rohloff hub)
- **Additional battery (800 Wh):** €600-€800
- **Popular accessories:** Captain's Chair (€250), Stow Decks (€140), large 52-liter panniers (pair)

For a family setup with two kids, expect:

- Bike + Captain's Chair + Stow Decks + front rack + panniers = €7,500-€8,500+ (S12 base)

## User Reviews & Experiences

### Pros

- **True adventure capability:** Only cargo bike that genuinely handles off-road, sand, and snow
- **Exceptional stability:** Low center of gravity, wide tires, long wheelbase
- **High load capacity:** 210 kg total (100 kg rear platform) with reinforced frame
- **Premium build quality:** EFBE-tested frame under extreme loads
- **Modularity:** Extensive Tern accessory catalog for customization
- **Quiet operation:** Belt drive option (R14) requires minimal maintenance
- **Connectivity:** Full Bosch Smart System integration with GPS geolocation
- **Comfort:** Very forgiving ride on rough terrain

### Cons

- **Extremely heavy:** Nearly 40 kg base weight; difficult to maneuver in tight spaces
- **Noisy tires:** Adventure tire options (especially Veetire) generate significant road noise
- **Gabarit:** Bulky, ~190 cm long; challenging to park and store
- **Very high price:** €9,300 for R14 is steep; entry-level S12 at €6,799 is also premium
- **Overkill for urban use:** Pure city commuting doesn't justify the expense and weight
- **No telescopic seatpost:** Would improve mounting/dismounting when heavily loaded
- **Rohloff underutilized:** On-road, the 14-speed hub doesn't show its advantage; better on trails
- **Tire selection:** Standard Schwalbe option noisier than preferred for road riding
