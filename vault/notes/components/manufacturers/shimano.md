## Shimano

Shimano is a Japanese multinational manufacturer of cycling components, fishing tackle, and rowing equipment. Their **STEPS** (Shimano Total Electric Power System) series is a major player in the e-bike market.

## E-Bike Systems (STEPS)

- **Shimano EP8 / EP801:** A lightweight, powerful, and intelligent mid-drive motor, often found on high-performance e-cargo bikes and e-MTBs. The EP801 is the cargo-specific version. It's known for its natural ride feel.
- **Shimano E6100:** A versatile and quiet motor system designed for city and trekking use, also found on many cargo bikes.

## Gearing Systems

Shimano also produces a wide range of gearing systems, including:

- **Nexus Inter-5/Inter-8:** Internal gear hubs that are low-maintenance and allow for shifting while stationary, a useful feature for cargo bikes that often stop and start in city traffic.
- **Deore / XT:** Traditional external derailleur systems known for their reliability and wide gear range.
