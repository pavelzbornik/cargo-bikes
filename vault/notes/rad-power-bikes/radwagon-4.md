## Overview

The Rad Power Radwagon 4 is an American electric longtail cargo bike designed for versatile transportation. It's positioned as an entry-level option in the premium longtail market, representing one of the most affordable electric longtail solutions available in Europe. The bike aims to democratize cargo bike ownership while maintaining functional design principles.

**Important Note:** Rad Power Bikes has announced ceasing European operations to focus on the North American market. Exercise caution regarding warranty, service, and parts availability before purchasing.

## Technical Specifications

### Dimensions & Weight

- **Length:** 200 cm
- **Weight:** ~35 kg
- **Capacity:** 158 kg (lowest in its category)
- **Wheel Size:** 22" front and rear

### Motor & Battery

- **Motor:** "Motoréducteur" brand hub motor (rear-mounted, 250W nominal)
- **Motor Torque:** Not fully specified
- **Battery:** Samsung 672 Wh (external mount on frame)
- **Range:** Approximately 100 km autonomy
- **Assist System:** No torque sensor - delivers full motor power regardless of pedal intensity (comfort concern)

### Mechanical Components

- **Brakes:** Tektro disc brakes (mechanical, not hydraulic)
- **Transmission:** Shimano 7-speed derailleur
- **Drivetrain:** Standard chain drive
- **Front Fork:** Suspended

## E-Bike Features

- Single-speed configuration only; no customization available
- External battery mounting (not integrated into frame)
- Motor in rear hub (less natural pedaling feel vs. pedal-mounted motors)
- No torque sensor; full motor power on demand may feel abrupt

## Real-World Performance

### Advantages

- Accessible pricing makes electric longtail feasible for budget-conscious buyers
- Relatively compact footprint (200 cm) compared to other longtails
- Established American brand with proven track record in North America

### Concerns

- **Critical:** Lack of torque sensor results in on-off motor engagement rather than smooth assistance progression
- Mechanical disc brakes on a loaded cargo bike are less reliable than hydraulic systems
- Motor brand and technical details are opaque; parts sourcing may be problematic
- 158 kg capacity is significantly lower than competitors (most offer 170-200 kg)
- European support and service network minimal or non-existent

## Cargo Capacity & Use Cases

- **Max Load:** 158 kg total (bike + rider + cargo)
- **Rear Rack Capacity:** Limited configuration options
- **Typical Use:** Urban commuting, light groceries, limited child transport

Not ideal for families needing to transport multiple children simultaneously or for heavy cargo loads.

## Maintenance

- Mechanical brakes require regular adjustment (vs. hydraulic requiring less maintenance)
- Motor in rear hub complicates tire repair procedures
- Unknown motor brand may result in longer downtimes for repairs

## Accessories & Pricing

Standard configuration at **2,299€ includes:**

- Rear rack (basic)

Additional accessories (not included):

- Front rack: +120€
- Rear footrests: +99€
- Monkey bars: +150€

**Fully equipped total: ~2,668€** (lowest cost complete cargo setup in market)

## User Reviews & Experiences

### Pros

- Unbeatable price point for electric longtail entry
- American brand reputation (in home market)
- Compact design relative to category

### Cons

- Abrupt motor engagement without torque sensor creates uncomfortable pedaling sensation
- Mechanical brakes inadequate for fully-loaded cargo scenarios
- Opaque component sourcing raises durability concerns
- European support essentially non-existent post-withdrawal announcement
