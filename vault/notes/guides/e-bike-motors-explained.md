The motor is the heart of an e-bike. Its position and type significantly impact the bike's performance and feel.

## Motor Position

### 1. Hub Motors

Hub motors are located in the hub of the front or rear wheel.

- **Rear Hub Motor:**
  - **Pros:** Good traction, feels like the bike is being "pushed." Common on more affordable e-bikes.
  - **Cons:** Can make changing a rear flat tire more complicated.
- **Front Hub Motor:**
  - **Pros:** Easier to install and maintain. Can feel like the bike is being "pulled."
  - **Cons:** Can sometimes have less traction on loose or steep surfaces.

### 2. Mid-Drive Motors

Mid-drive motors are located in the center of the bike's frame, where the pedals are. The motor drives the crank, not the wheel directly.

- **Pros:**
  - **Balanced Weight:** The central location provides a low center of gravity and better balance.
  - **Efficient Gearing:** The motor leverages the bike's existing gears, making it more efficient on hills.
  - **Natural Feel:** Power is applied to the pedals, which feels more like traditional cycling.
  - **Easy Wheel Changes:** Since the motor is not in the wheel, fixing a flat is the same as on a regular bike.
- **Cons:**
  - Can cause more wear on the chain and gears.
  - Often more expensive.

## Motor Power

- **Watts (W):** A measure of the motor's power. In Europe, e-bike motors are legally limited to 250W of continuous power for road use.
- **Torque (Nm):** Newton-meters measure the rotational force of the motor. Higher torque is better for starting from a standstill and climbing hills.
