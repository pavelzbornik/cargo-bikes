Cargo bikes come in various shapes and sizes. Understanding the terminology can help you choose the right one for your needs.

## Main Types of Cargo Bikes

- **Long-tail:** These bikes have an extended rear frame over the back wheel, providing space for cargo, accessories, or passengers. They handle much like a regular bicycle, making them a popular choice.
- **Front-loader (or Bakfiets):** These bikes have a cargo box or platform in front of the rider, between the handlebars and the front wheel. They can carry large loads and are very stable when parked.
- **Mid-tail:** A more compact version of the long-tail, offering more cargo capacity than a regular bike without the full length of a long-tail.

## Other Common Terms

- **Payload Capacity:** The maximum weight (including rider, passengers, and cargo) that the bike is designed to carry.
- **Wheelbase:** The distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels. A longer wheelbase generally provides more stability, especially when carrying heavy loads.
- '**Toptube**': The top bar of the bike frame. Some cargo bikes have a low or step-through toptube for easier mounting and dismounting.
